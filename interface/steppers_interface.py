class SteppersInterface(metaclass=InterfaceMetaclass):
    """ This interface is used to manage multiples axis piezo steppers.

    This interface is not for doing scans. It is a wrapper around general piezo steppers features
    to control them "by hand".
    It can be useful for debugging or prototyping and also to provide tools for semi automatic calibration

    Piezo steppers are a useful device to access different zone of a sample over long distances.
    If you have a controller, you can use this interface to interact with it.

    ##### Getters and setters

    This interface implement getters and setters as only one overloaded function.
    For these function, if a value is provided, it is set as new value.
    In every case, the last value is returned

    ##### Buffered value

    Sometime you want to get the last read value of a parameter for a non critical fast application.
    In this case, you can pass the _buffered_ = True option so that the hardware module respond right away.
